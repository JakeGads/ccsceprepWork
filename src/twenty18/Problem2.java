You have been given the job of creating a new order processing system for the Yummy
Fruit CompanyTM. The system reads pricing information for the various delicious varieties of fruit stocked by YFC, 
and then processes invoices from customers, determining

the total amount for each invoice based on the type and quantity of fruit for each line item
in the invoice.

The program input starts with the pricing information. Each fruit price (single quantity) is specified on a single line, 
with the fruit name followed by the price. You can
assume that each fruit name is a single word consisting of alphabetic characters (A–Z and
a–z). You can also assume that prices will have exactly two decimal places after the decimal point. 
Fruit names and prices are separated by a single space character. The list of
fruit prices is terminated by a single line consisting of the text END_PRICES.
After the fruit prices, there will be one or more invoices. Each invoice consists of a
series of line items. A line item is a fruit name followed by an integer quantity, with the
fruit name and quantity separated by a single space. You can assume that no line item will
specify a fruit name that is not specified in the fruit prices. Each invoice is terminated by
a line consisting of the text END_INVOICE. As a special case, if a line with the text QUIT
appears instead of the beginning of an invoice, the program should exit immediately. The
overall input will always be terminated by a QUIT line.
